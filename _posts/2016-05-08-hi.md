Hi there and welcome to my blog.

I have tried to write blog posts in the past, but have found it hard to pick topics I think will be genuinely useful to people.

Now, I'm going to give it another go. Right now I'm in the process of writing a series of posts aiming to demystify functional programming. Hopefully the first of these will be finished in the next week or so.

If you have any questions/comments/generally want a chat, get in touch (links below).

Hamish.
