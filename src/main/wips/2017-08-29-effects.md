# Future for effect

In this post I'm going to talk a little about scala's `Future` and it's relationship with functional programming.


## Managing effects in FP




## Strictness

You can think of `Future` as a strict `IO` or `Task`.

What does that mean?



the problem becomes when thing execute, for example this

```tut
import cats._, cats.data._, cats.implicits._

object program1 {
  val foo = Future { println("foo") }

  val bar = Future { println("bar") }

  val p = bar >> foo
}
```

is not the same program as

```tut
object program2 {
  val p = Future { println("bar") } >> Future { println("foo") }
}
```


because `Future` is strict, we've lost referential transparency and so equational reasoning - that is, we can't simply replace code in our program with their definitions.

In contrast, `IO`/`Task` are non-strict (which for here is the same as being lazy) which does give you equational reasoning, for example these two programs are the same

```tut
import cats.effect.IO

object program3 {
  val foo = IO { println("foo") }

  val bar = IO { println("bar") }

  val p = bar >> foo
}
```

and

```tut
object program4 {
  val p = IO { println("bar") } >> IO { println("foo") }
}
```

The price we have to pay here is we have to now "run" our program

```tut
program3.p.unsafePerformIO
```


```tut
program4.p.unsafePerformIO
```
