As an industry I think it's time we accept that we have serious problems with the way we recruit staff.

So what's the cause of all this? I think it's largely _our_ fault. Think about it - in what other industry would you invite someone in for an interview who is helping to develop the language you work on, who has spoken at conferences for years ... and then give them the same interview you would a new graduate?
