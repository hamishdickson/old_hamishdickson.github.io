A couple of weekends ago I was lucky enough to attend a Typelevel hack day at Salesforce Tower in London. Miles Sabin did an excellent workshop on hacking the Scala compilier (based on his experience fixing the notorious SI-2717 bug), in the workshop we fixed a [minor bug in the typechecker](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5162).

During this Miles spoke a little bit about Scala's type system and I realised that I hadn't seen any good blog posts about it.
