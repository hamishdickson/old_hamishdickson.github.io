I am a developer based in London, England. After about 7 years writing financial software, I now work for a startup where I do analytics and java things.

My academic background is in Theoretical Physics, mainly around the limits of Quantum Information Theory. My interests are mainly around physics, maths and functional programming.

When I'm not coding, reading about code, reading physics or generally nerding out, you will normally find me at my local crossfit gym.
