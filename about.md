Hamish is a developer based in London, England. He works for a startup doing analytics and Java things. His interest lies in functional programming, maths and physics.

I try to make as much of my code open source as possible. Not all of it is good practice or for that matter 100% functional, however hopefully it's useful or at least points those stuck in the right direction.

When I'm not coding, reading about code, reading physics or generally nerding out, you will normally find me at my local crossfit gym.
