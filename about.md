I am a developer based in London, England. After about 7 years writing financial software, I now work for a startup where I do analytics and Java things.

My academic background is in Theoretical Physics, which I studied at Imperial College London. My interests are mainly around physics, maths and functional programming.

I try to make as much of my code open source as possible. Not all of it is good practice or for that matter 100% working, however it's important to me to help the open source community where I can and maybe someone can find some use in what I've done.

When I'm not coding, reading about code, reading physics or generally nerding out, you will normally find me at my local crossfit gym.
