My name is Hamish and I live and work in London, England.

I work for a startup and am interested in functional programming, physics and maths. I also like to pick heavy things up and down in the gym.

I am not looking for work, so if you are a recruiter please leave me alone.

You can find my github stuff [here](https://github.com/hamishdickson) and you can get in touch via [twitter](https://twitter.com/_mishy) or I'm on the [scala gitter channel](https://gitter.im/scala/scala) almost all day long.
