My name is Hamish and I live and work in London, England.

I'm interested in functional programming, physics and maths. I also like to pick heavy things up in the gym.

I am part of the Scala team at DriveTribe, where we do awesome things in functional programming. I really enjoy what I do and I'm not looking for work, so if you are a recruiter please leave me alone.

You can find my github stuff [here](https://github.com/hamishdickson) and you can get in touch via [twitter](https://twitter.com/_mishy) also I'm on the [scala gitter channel](https://gitter.im/scala/scala) almost all day long.
