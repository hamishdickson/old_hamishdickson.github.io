I found this fascinating\n                and would love to know more or work on an interesting machine learning problem (I\'ve been trying to find\n                something open source to contribute to, but so far haven\'t found anything that catches my eye).</p>\n\n            <p>I\'d really like to know more about genetics, how the brain works and biology in general - I think this\n                area\n                has a lot of untapped potential for interesting maths and computer modelling.</p>\n\n            <p>Turbulence and fluid dynamics are very interesting to me, we know the small picture very well (we know\n                how individual molecules should act), but when the system gets above a certain size everything goes out\n                the\n                window and we have to make very general guesses as to what will happen.</p>\n\n            <p>I did physics at university and still absolutely love it.

My father worked for a giant oil\n        company when I was young and so it was normal for me to move every year or so.</p>\n\n        <p>Having said that, I\'ve now lived in London for 13 years. I came to university here, enjoyed every second so\n        went out my way to stay.</p>\n\n        <p>I now work for a company who makes software for investment banks. While not the most rewarding work, I work\n        with great people and love working with them.</p>\n\n        <p>So here is my problem: London is insane.</p>\n\n        <p>Let me break that down a bit, firstly it\'s impossible for a normal person to buy a house here. I earn an OK\n            wage (I could earn more doing similar work at a bank, but as explained above it\'s not that rewarding and\n            hey, I like the people I work with) but have no real savings (certainly not that 50 grand plus needed for\n            a deposit).</p>\n\n        <p>Secondly: The Tube. If that needs explaining, then you\'ve probably not been to London.</p>\n\n        <p>Thirdly: It\'s expensive.</p>\n\n        <p>So these points (and many more) would be worth it if I went out a lot or did lots of things in London, but that\n        really doesn\'t happen - I get up, code some stuff, go to work, go to the gym, come home and crash out. Then do it\n        all again. I don\'t take advantage of this place.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"blog-footer\">Hamish - 17th May 2015</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <hr>\n\n    <div>\n        <h3>Coursera deadlines</h3>\n        <p>So I\'ve been working on Coursera\'s Programming Course for the last few weeks - one of the things that always\n        gets me about Coursera is it\'s weirdly strict deadlines.
