    <h3>My code</h3>

    <p>I love open source software and try to make as much of my own software publically available as possible.
        GitHub is brilliant for that, so you can find a lot of what I'm allowed to
        publish <a href="https://github.com/hamishdickson" target="_blank">over here</a>.</p>

    <p>Much of this code is what could be described as "code for learning" - meaning in of it self it's not
        terribly useful, but it's good reference material.</p>
