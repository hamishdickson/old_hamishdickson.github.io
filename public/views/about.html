                    here
                    for two main reasons, so I can easily keep it up to date on github and to make it easy for people to find.

                        It's really important to me that I stay challenged and keep learning. I actually

            <h3>My code</h3>

            <p>I love open source software and try to make as much of my own software publically available as possible.
                GitHub is brilliant for that, so you can find a lot of what I'm allowed to
                publish <a href="https://github.com/hamishdickson" target="_blank">over here</a>.</p>

            <p>Much of this code is what could be described as "code for learning" - meaning in of it self it's not
                terribly useful, but it's good reference material.</p>

            <p>I'm really passionate about coding and learning new things, but realistically you can't do
                that 24/7 and absorb it all - I like to get away from it all by going to the gym and lifting
                heavy things up and down. I'm also really into my rugby and lacrosse.</p>

            <h3>More about me</h3>

            <h4>What interests me</h4>

            <p>I've recently finished Andrew Ng's excellent Machine Learning coursera course. I found this fascinating
            and would love to know more or work on an interesting machine learning problem (I've been trying to find
            something open source to contribute to, but so far haven't found anything that catchs my eye).</p>

            <p>I'd really like to know more about genetics, how the brain works and biology in general - I think this
                area
                has a lot of untapped potential for interesting maths and computer modelling.</p>

            <p>Turbulence and fluid dynamics are very interesting to me, we know the small picture very well (we know
            how individual molecules should act), but when the system gets above a certain size everything goes out the
            window and we have to make very general guesses as to what will happen.</p>

            <p>I did physics at university and still absolutely love it. I still read a lot of physics and
                maths.</p>

            <hr>
            <h4>What I'm good at</h4>

            <p>At my last performance review, my boss said this of me: "I love Hamish's massive geekyness"</p>

            <p>I'm at my best when given a "go away and solve this" problem.</p>

            <p>I'm good at teaching. Over the last few years I have taught lots of new graduates to code and
                analyse problems.</p>

            <p>No one can work on their own all the time, I've always been good at working with people (I'm
                a fan of a type of pair programming) and I'm very good at getting my ideas across to people.</p>

            <h3>Learning</h3>

            <p>Keeping on top of new ideas and concepts is very important as a programmer, you have to
                constantly be out
                learning new things (this fits my personality well, so I'm pretty happy with it!)</p>
